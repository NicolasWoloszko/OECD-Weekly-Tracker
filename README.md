The OECD Weekly Tracker of GDP growth provides a high-frequency indicator of economic activity with a delay of less than five days, making it particularly useful when activity is changing very rapidly. It also has a wide country coverage of OECD and G20 countries. The Tracker is thus particularly well suited to assessing activity during the turbulent period of the current global pandemic. The Tracker provides estimates of year-on-year growth rate in weekly GDP. It applies a machine learning model to a panel of Google Trends data for 46 countries, and aggregates together information about search behaviour related to consumption, labour markets, housing, trade, industrial activity and economic uncertainty.

Charts for OECD and G20 countries are in the [Figures](Figures) folder. Charts for selected countries are to be found below.

Monthly GDP growth series are used when available (for the United Kingdom and Canada). The darkness of the grey background reflects confinement stringency based on the Oxford Blavatnik Index.
